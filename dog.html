            <h2>Dog-Care</h2>
            <p>A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a
              first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority.
              Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.<br>To take care of any dog you need to provide a protected
              and clean living environment for your dog.You also
              need to feed your dog a quality diet and prevent obesity.Have your pet checked reqularly by a veterinarian
              You can also communicate with your dog and develop a relationship and train your dog to follow the simple
              commands.Finally you should always take care of the dog's teeth,Dental care is very IMPORTANT,many breeds
              are
              prone to gum disease which can have serious implications.<br>Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest,
              away from all drafts and off the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or
              pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot of time outdoors,
              be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter
              when it's cold.<br>Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you
              suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal
              Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.</p>

                  <h2>Cat-Care</h2>
                  <p>We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food.Your veterinerian will be able
                    to
                    access your new cat or kitten and determinethe best diet.Cats require taurine,an essential
                    amino-acid for
                    heart and eye health.You will need to provide fresh,clean water ata all times, and wash and refill
                    your
                    cat's water bowls daily.Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.Cats also need to be
                    groomed,you
                    should brush or comb your cat regularly,frequent brushing helps you keep your cat's coat clean,it
                    reduces
                    the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.Cats should have their own
                    clean,dry
                    place in your home to rest.To pick up your cat ,place one hand behind the front legs and another
                    under the
                    hindquarters,lift gently,never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.<br>Your
                    pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest. Line your cat's bed with a
                    soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors.
                    Outdoor cats do not live as long as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or
                    from fights with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat cats. Outdoor
                    cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as well as contract infectious
                    diseases.<br>If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID tag. A safety collar
                    with an elastic panel will allow your cat to break loose if the collar gets caught on something. And
                    for both indoor and outdoor cats, an ID tag or an implanted microchip can help ensure that your cat
                    is returned if he or she becomes lost.
