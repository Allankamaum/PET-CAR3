        <h2>Cat-Care</h2>
        <p>We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food.Your veterinerian will be able to access your new cat or kitten and determinethe best diet.Cats require taurine,an essential amino-acid for heart and eye health.You will need to provide fresh,clean water ata all times, and wash and refill your cat's water bowls daily.Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.Cats also need to be groomed,you should brush or comb your cat regularly,frequent brushing helps you keep your cat's coat clean,it reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.Cats should have their own clean,dry place in your home to rest.To pick up your cat ,place one hand behind the front legs and another under the hindquarters,lift gently,never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or by the front legs.</p>
