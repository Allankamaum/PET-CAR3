                <h2 id="mirror">PARROT SPECIES.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph1">
                    <P>Many larger species live a long time - up to 70 years, or even more. Smaller birds such as budgies and cockatiels can still live as long as a healthy pet dog - 15 years or so. So, for example, if you buy a large parrot as a retirement
                        present, bear in mind that the bird is very likely to outlive its owner.</p>
                    <p> African Greys and Cockatoos are messy birds, with lots of ‘dander’ (a type of avian dandruff). This makes them a poor choice for anyone who suffers bird allergies - they are more liable to cause asthma and sneezing than other parrots.</p>
                    <p> Lories and Lorikeets need a fruit and nectar diet, which makes their droppings very liquid, and their cages, as a consequence, very messy. They are surprisingly good at squirting it out between the bars too! Many species - notably
                        the Amazons - become very ‘squawky’ if they do not receive enough attention from their owners. Macaws tend to turn nasty if they do not receive enough attention; and some older birds seem to develop a mean streak regardless of
                        how you treat them. Many species, including Macaws, will pluck themselves when stressed, and stress can be anything from too much light or noise, to overcrowding and frustrated mating urges.</P>
                </div>
                <h2 id="mirror1">PARROT FOOD.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph2">
                    <p>Fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, a little extra protein in the form of cooked meat, and a base of specially formulated parrot mix. That’s the basis of most pet parrots’ diets.</P>
                    <P> But there is no single diet that suits all types of parrot. It’s not just a matter of size, either. Lories and Lorikeets feed on nectar in the wild, Hyacinth Macaws are mad for nuts , and some species thrive on a fairly carnivorous
                        diet.
                    </P>
                    <P> Finding out every last detail about your specific parrot’s dietary requirements is important if you want to give the bird the best chance of a long, healthy life. Some can be fussy, or can become attached to certain foods. It’s important
                        that all birds eat the full range of fresh, dry and formulated foods that cover all the nutritional ground they need.</P>
                </div>
                <h2 id="mirror2">PARROT BEHAVIOUR.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph3">
                    <P>Lots of what your pet birds do will be self-explanatory – things like feeding, flying, bickering, bathing, and climbing. But there are other types of movement and body language that require a little homework on your part if you are
                        to fully understand what your parrot is ‘saying’ with his body.</P>
                    <p>Beaks Grinding and Clicking – see the Parrot Sounds section. Jousting – birds that grab each other's beaks in a kind of wrestling match are simply playing. If real anger is involved, there will be a lot more flapping and squawking.
                        Wiping – Parrots, like most birds, wipe their beaks after eating, especially if the food is wet or slightly messy (banana, for example). Some parrots wipe wet beaks as a means of marking territory.</p>
                    <p>Biting This is always an unwelcome behaviour, and is a sign of aggression, over-defensiveness or fear. You can see most bites coming – the bird will crouch and open his beak prior to the lunge. Getting the parrot used to your presence
                        will help to defuse the behaviour. If it’s taking place in an aviary, you may have an overcrowding problem. If all else fails, a biter will have to be isolated from the other birds until he shows signs of calming down.
                    </p>
                    <p>Crests Cockatiels and Cockatoos use their crests to express themselves. When relaxed and happy, the bird will have its crest flat or ever-so-slightly raised. If the bird is crouching and hissing, however, this means he is angry and
                        afraid. A raised crest indicates excitement. This is usually a sign that the parrot is pleased to see you (or the food you are carrying!). This is not to be confused with a crest that’s fully-raised and stays in that position.
                        This is a sign of fear, anger or some other over-stimulated state of mind. Beware the angry peck!</p>

                <h2 id="mirror3">PARROTS AND DISEASES.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph4">
                    <p>Parrots and Disease If your birds are kept clean and on a healthy diet, you are very unlikely to catch disease from them. To be on the safe side, always wash your hands with soap and water after any contact with parrots, whether handling
                        them, cleaning the cage or merely changing the food bowls. You could also protect your hands with rubber gloves, and wear a mask to avoid breathing in dust from the cage. Never hold food in your mouth for the parrots to take, and
                        avoid kissing them. If you follow these common sense rules, and ensure that everyone else in the household does likewise, you have little to fear.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 id="mirror4">COMMON PARROT DISEASES.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph5">
                    <p>Aspergillus. This is a fungal infection of parrots’ air sacs and lungs, usually contracted in damp or dirty environments where the fungus can bloom. The symptoms are breathing difficulties, with an audible wheezing, accompanied by
                        fluffed-up feathers and a generally ‘poorly’ appearance. There is sometimes discharge from the nostrils.</P>
                    <p>Avian Gastric Yeast (AGY) infection (Wasting Disease). Also known as macrorhabdiosis, or megabacteriosis, this highly contagious infection is caused by a mixture of yeast infection and secondary bacterial infection. It affects budgies
                        mainly. It is difficult to spot in the early stages, incubating with no outward sign of trouble. The first outward sign is weight loss, as AGY impedes digestion. There will be undigested food in the droppings, and birds may vomit
                        food and mucus.</p>
                    <p>Candida virus (Thrush), or Candidiasis. This is a yeast infection, the same one that infects humans. It blooms in the parrot’s crop or digestive tract, and will not be transmitted to humans via birds unless you allow them to ‘kiss’
                        you (an ill-advised ‘trick’ that some owners like to teach their birds). Infected birds will be listless and may have loose droppings. As these are symptoms of many kinds of ailment, a trip to the vet for diagnosis is essential.
                        Candida is easily treatable.</p>
                    <p>Colds, Sneezes. Parrots can catch colds (although the viruses are different to that which infects humans) , and the symptoms are similar - runny noses, swollen eyes, wheezing and sneezing. In parrots, however, the condition can lead
                        to rapid decline, and a vet’s administrations will be required.</p>
                </div>
                <h2 id="mirror5">PARROT BREEDING.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph6">
                    <p>With several dozen different species of parrot commonly kept as pets, this section of our guide can only deal in generalisations. Each species has its own particular requirements, and specialist advice should be sought for the particular
                        birds you are trying to breed. Generally speaking, breeding birds must be kept apart from other pairs, or from a non-breeding flock. Parents become very territorial, and life-threatening squabbles are inevitable. If you only keep
                        a pair of parrots, this is not going to be a problem. If you want to work on a grander scale, you will need to install a custom-made breeding aviary, with separate sections for each pair.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h2 id="mirror6">PARROT AVIARY.</h2>
                <div id="paragraph7">
                    <p>Size matters! An outdoor aviary isn’t just an al fresco cage. It should give the parrots as much space as possible for flight, and offer a warm and comfortable roosting space too. The species of parrot you keep will determine the minimum
                        size of the space, although even smaller species enjoy long, unimpeded flight-paths. In fact the smaller parrots tend to fly more than their larger cousins. The size of the area you have available should act as a starting point
                        for the type and number of birds you are going to keep.</p>
