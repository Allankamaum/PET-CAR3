        <h4 class="header4">1 – Gastrointestinal Stasis</h4>
         <p> This serious and potentially fatal condition occurs more commonly in rabbits than one would like to imagine. And what makes it so serious is that the symptoms are extremely difficult to spot.</p>
         <p>G stasis occurs when the rabbit’s digestive system comes to a halt. Any rabbit food that the rabbit consumes is no longer processed and the metabolism is shut down.</p>
        <h5 class="header5">Symptoms</h5>
         <p>Lethargy, lack of appetite, bloating and reduced fecal matter. One of the easiest ways to detect GI Stasis in rabbits is to rest your ears on your bunny’s abdomen gently and listen for sounds of the digestive system functioning normally. There’s typically a gurgling sound or something similar. If you do not hear any sounds at all, then there are chances that the digestive system may have shut down.</p>
       </div>


       <div class="two">
        <h4>2 – Ear Mites</h4>
        <p>Ear Mites are undoubtedly among the most common health conditions that can occur in rabbits. That’s irrespective of whether you keep your bunny indoors or outdoors. The good news is that the condition appears to be a lot more serious than it actually is. It is easily treatable. Having said that, if left untreated, it can quickly progress into secondary infections of the middle and inner ear. In extreme cases, mite infestations can also progress to meningitis. So, like any other health condition, you might want to start diagnosis and early treatment for ear mites.</p>
        <p>Ear mites are contagious. So the chances of your bunny picking up mites after coming into contact with another infected bunny are high.</p>
        <h5>Symptoms</h5>
        <p>One of the first symptoms of an ear mite infestation is intense bouts of itching around the ears, neck and head. The itching may be generalized or focused mainly around the ears. There will be scales on the inner ear which will eventually form thick crusted lesions. There may be hair loss and occasional peeling of the skin. If the infestation has penetrated into the inner ear, it may cause loss of balance or head tilt in bunnies. Mite infestations can also spread to other parts of the rabbit’s body especially the belly and the area that surrounds the anus.</p>

        <div class="three">
        <h4>3 – Sore Hocks</h4>
        <p> ‘sore hocks’ is a condition in which the sole on the rabbit’s rear legs get infected and inflamed. The condition is typically localized in the area of the rabbit’s feet which come into contact with the floor as the rabbit rests.</p>
        <h5>Symptoms</h5>
        <p>Sore Hocks can range from mild to severe and are usually graded depending on the severity of the condition. In grades I to III, the condition is considered moderate and the bunny will show signs of hair loss near the bottom of the rear feet. Swelling is rare but not unusual. In some cases, the skin will become excessively red and may form scabs and ulcers which can be prone to infection.</p>

        <div class="four">
          <h4>1.Regular Exercise</h4>
          <p>Rabbits by nature, are free-roaming and able to get as much exercise as they need throughout the day. Pet rabbits are no different than wild rabbits in that they require regular exercise to remain as healthy as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="five">
          <h4>2.Diet</h4>
          <p>If your rabbit’s diet isn’t on point, it may be at risk of health issues. Just like us humans, your rabbits need a well-balanced and nutritional food. Unlike us humans, domesticated rabbits can’t control what they eat. So, it’s down to you as the owner to ensure you’re feeding it the best food.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="six">
          <h4>3.Veterenary </h4>
          <p>You should make an effort to visit the vet at least once a year excluding the rabbit's shots. Also when you notice symptoms like the one's stated above in the health section make a point of visiting the vet as soon as possible as it may be serious.</p>
